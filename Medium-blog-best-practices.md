# Best Practices to follow for PWiC Medium Post
Here are the best practices to follow while preparing and publishing a medium blog post:
1. Credit photographer
    - Example: Photo credits: Snapshot Photography
    - add a link to the photographer's site
2. Credit Marketing team: example: 
    - Design credits: weprint
    - Add a link to the design team's website - <Need link>
3. Headings -  Use T headings instead of bold for section headings
4. If an organization is mentioned, add hyperlinks to that organization
5. If an individual is mentioned, add a link to their LinkedIn Profile
6. Add links to resources and reference materials.  For example github repo links to PWiC github resources would be great
7. Add "About the author" section at the end of the article
