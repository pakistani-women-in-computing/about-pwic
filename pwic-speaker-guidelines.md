# PWiC Speaker Guidelines

In addition to accepting the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pakistani-women-in-computing/pwic-documents/blob/master/pwic-code-of-conduct.md) for all attendees, speakers must agree to our rules for speaking. 
Failure to follow these rules will result in disqualification for speaking at PWiC events.

**Views expressed by speakers at PWiC events are their own and do not represent Pakistani Women in Computing (PWiC).**

## All Speakers

### Expected Behavior 
All speakers must register for PWiC event. 

- If you are unable to speak after confirming your participation, please let PWiC know as soon as possible at info@pwic.org.
- All speakers commit to presenting as scheduled by PWiC event's team.
- If you have a scheduling conflict for religious reasons, please reach out to us so we can accommodate you.
- Speakers must arrive to their assigned location 15 minutes before their session begins.
- Speakers must discuss the work for which they were selected to present. 
- Any handouts you provide to attendees must be directly relevant to the session topic and your work.

### Unacceptable Behavior 
- Speakers may not use their scheduled talk to promote irrelevant agendas.
- Speakers may only hand out promotional materials and/or swag before, during, or after their session relevant to the event or the talk.
- All material (presentations, promotional material) to be presented or distributed at the event should be submitted to the organizing team 48 hours prior for vetting against our code of conduct and other policies. PWiC team will use their discretion to allow any unvetted material to be shared at the event.
