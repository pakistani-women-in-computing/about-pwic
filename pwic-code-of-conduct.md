# PWiC Participant Guidelines

## Code of Conduct
The Pakistani Women in Computing (PWiC) believes our community should be truly open for everyone. 
We are dedicated to providing an empowering experience for everyone who participates in or supports our global community. Our events are intended to inspire women to grow in technology careers, and anyone who is there for this purpose is welcome. PWiC values the safety and security of our members and strive to have an inclusive community, we do not tolerate harassment  participants in any form. 

As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all attendees, sponsors, volunteers, speakers,  organizers, venue staff, media, vendors and other guests (collectively, “Participants”) of the PWiC events free from discrimination  for any reason including on the basis of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, race, ethnicity, age and religion.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for Participant behavior as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all Participants to help us realize a safe and positive experience for everyone.

## Scope
PWiC expects all Participants to abide by these guidelines at all the PWiC events. Participants seek to learn, network, and have fun. Please do so responsibly and with respect for the right of others to do likewise. Thank you for your cooperation in helping us maintain a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment.

## Expected Behavior
All Participants are expected to: be considerate, respectful, and collaborative; refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behavior or speech; be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow Participants – your fellow Participants may have a different level of comfort with respect to language and personal space. 

## Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behaviors include sexual language and imagery, sexist, racist, and exclusionary jokes, trolling, and acts that insult or belittle other event attendees in any way. These are unacceptable at any and all PWiC events. Other forms of harassment and discriminatory behavior include, but are not limited to: offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status, caste or creed; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; unwarranted photography or recording; sustained disruption of event programming; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to  immediately comply and may be removed from the event without warning by any member of PWiC leadership (local chapter/community leads, PWiC officer bearers). Participants are expected to comply with the PWiC Code of Conduct at all event venues.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
If a participant engages in behavior which is harassing or discriminatory in any way, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate. These actions include, but are not limited to, issuing a warning or expulsion from all future events.
